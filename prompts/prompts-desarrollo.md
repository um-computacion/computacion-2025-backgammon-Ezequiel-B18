## Dice Implementation for Backgammon

### Prompt
```
This is a Backgammon project, we'll first start by implementing the dice class so that we have a logic for the randomness, remember to follow a TDD logic, that would mean tests first, logic later. 

Try to cover all the possible cases for the dice in the backgammon game, that would mean double dices, the first throw, etc.
```

### Response
Created a comprehensive implementation of the Dice class for a Backgammon game following Test-Driven Development principles:

1. First, designed and implemented test cases covering:
   - Dice initialization
   - Ensuring dice values are within the proper range (1-6)
   - Verifying that rolls use randomness (with mocking)
   - Detecting doubles (when both dice show the same value)
   - Handling the special case of doubles (returning four moves instead of two)
   - Managing the initial roll to determine the first player
   - Identifying ties in the initial roll
   - Determining which player rolled higher

2. Then implemented the Dice class with:
   - Methods for rolling the dice
   - Logic to detect doubles
   - Functionality to get available moves (accounting for doubles)
   - Special handling for the initial roll
   - Method to determine which player rolled higher

The implementation follows SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: The Dice class only handles dice-related logic
- **Open/Closed**: The design allows for extension without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: No inheritance in this implementation yet
- **Interface Segregation**: Methods have clear, focused responsibilities
- **Dependency Inversion**: No hard-coded dependencies on concrete implementations

## Board Implementation for Backgammon

### Prompt
```
Now let's do the same for the next class which should be the board. First the tests, then add all changes to the CHANGELOG.md as well as to the prompts/ folder. Remember that the board should handle only the logic for the board
```

### Response
Created a comprehensive implementation of the Board class for a Backgammon game following Test-Driven Development principles:

1. First, designed and implemented test cases covering:
   - Board initialization with the standard starting position
   - Moving checkers between points
   - Handling invalid moves
   - Managing checkers on the bar
   - Bearing off checkers
   - Checking for a winner
   - Querying the board state

2. Then implemented the Board class with:
   - Standard backgammon board representation with 24 points
   - Functions for moving checkers between points
   - Rules enforcement for valid moves
   - Bar functionality for hit checkers
   - Home board check and bearing off functionality
   - Win condition detection
   - Helper methods for board state queries

The Board class is responsible solely for maintaining the state of the backgammon board and enforcing the rules for moving checkers. It does not handle game flow, players, or dice logic, keeping its responsibilities focused and clear.

## Game Implementation for Backgammon

### Prompt
```
Finally, implement the game class. Remember, tests first, then implementation. The game class should handle the overall game logic, integrating the dice and board classes. It should manage turn-taking, check for wins, and orchestrate the game flow.
```

### Response
Created a comprehensive implementation of the Game class for a Backgammon game following Test-Driven Development principles:

1. First, designed and implemented test cases covering:
   - Game initialization
   - Turn-taking between two players
   - Integrating dice rolls with board moves
   - Handling player decisions (move, double, etc.)
   - Checking for win conditions
   - Managing the game flow and state

2. Then implemented the Game class with:
   - Methods for starting and managing the game
   - Logic for player turns and actions
   - Integration with Dice and Board classes
   - Win condition checking and game ending

The Game class orchestrates the entire game, using the Dice and Board classes to manage the game state, player turns, and rule enforcement. It does not contain any game-specific logic outside of what is necessary to manage turns and check for wins, adhering to the principles of separation of concerns and single responsibility.
